= Recipes

I hate searching over and over for recipes
 
I'm putting them all here.

"Does it taste like the traditional recipe?"

"Well, I'm not fooled, but I am asking for seconds." 

Cooking is the closest thing I have to a hobby, besides video games, but I'm not really a "hobbyist"
What I generally want to do, is solve a problem, and move onto another problem. It just turns out I have a lot of food problems to solve. So these are about half-art, half-solution.
