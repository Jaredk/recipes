Adapted from lentil tortilla recipes and Bravetart's one bowl waffles.

Time:
-----
30 min prep with 100F water bath, overnight prep otherwise.
15 min cook per waffle batch (this makes one batch in my waffle iron)

Special Tools:
------
Waffle iron
immersion cooker(optional)
Blender(my $30 oster worked great)
Cooking spray
(timer, gram balance,  silicone spatula...)

Ingredients:
--------------
400g water
200g dry red lentils
4g salt

40g cooking oil
2g baking powder
3g baking soda

2 large egg whites (or 80g aquafaba)
7.5g vanilla extract

Process:
---------
Place lentils, water, and salt in a sealed container.  Soak until the lentils cover most of the water, about 30 minutes when immersed in 100F water, otherwise it's an overnight soak.

Preheat your waffle iron to medium heat,
It helps to put a pan under your waffle iron,
this batter hardens and sticks a lot when it drips out.

Place lentil mixture and all other ingredients into your blender.

Blend on low for a few minutes until smooth and fluffy (if the mix pops up a bit and stops churning, slow the blender or pause it for a bit)

Cook in the waffle iron for 15 minutes. Coat the iron with cooking spray before each batch.

These waffles will freeze and reheat wonderfully, getting even more toasty.
For reheating, I either toast twice on medium, straight from the freezer,
or I'll put a large batch of waffles in the oven for 20 minutes as the oven preheats to 400F.

I like to top with healthy off-brand cool whip and chopped frozen berries.
