Adapted from Serious Eats' vegan alfredo recipe

==Ingredients
355g water
340g frozen cauliflower florets
55g raw cashews
10g nutritional yeast
Microplaned zest of 1/2 lemon
Kosher salt
2g Garlic powder
Black Pepper and Parsley to top

==Steps
Preheat oven to 400F

Cut squash in half along meridian, scoop out seeds, coat flesh of squash with olive oil, sprinkle with salt.

Place squash halves flesh side down on parchment-lined sheet pan. Poke each half about a dozen times with a fork.

In a large saucepan, bring nut milk or broth to a simmer over medium heat. Add cauliflower and cashews and stir to coat with the liquid. Reduce heat to medium low, cover, and cook until the cauliflower is very tender when pierced with a knife, about 10 minutes. (If the liquid seems to be evaporating out from under the lid, reduce the heat to low; you want to cook the cauliflower while retaining as much of the liquid as possible.)

run water over the sides of the saucepan until the mixture falls below 120F, then blend that stuff for about 5 minutes, until smoooth
