Ever so slightly adapted from jeanetteshealthyliving korean lettuce wraps.

Time
----
30 minutes

Tools
----
large, non-nonstick skillet, or saucepan.
metal spoon
heat

Ingredients
-------
~454g lean ground "meat"
~454g regular american coleslaw mix (our bags are 14oz, they work fine)
30g Neutral cooking oil
1g garlic powder
4g onion flakes
36g Gochujang paste
22g mirin
30g soy sauce
sesame oil (optional)

Process
-----
heat oil, garlic, and onion in the saucepan on medium-high for about 15 seconds

add in meat, and brown it all, stirring frequently, about 5 minutes.

pour in sauces, stir to combine.

Add in coleslaw mix, raise heat to high, stir fry for four minutes, remove from heat.

Serve hot, drizzling over sesame oil for those who want it.  This s great filling for any wraps you'd like to make, but i prefer it simply, in a bowl.
