Preheat oven to 400F, rack at middle or one below.

(optional) Cook or reheat chicken to your liking.

Cut squash in half along meridian, scoop out seeds, coat flesh of squash with olive oil, sprinkle with salt.

Place squash halves flesh side down on parchment-lined sheet pan. Poke each half about a dozen times with a fork.

Put the squash in the oven, timed for 35 minutes.

In a large saucepan, pour the water, and salt it to taste of the sea.  Simmer over medium heat. Add cauliflower and cashews and stir to coat with the liquid. Cover and Simmer on LOW for about ten minutes..

run water over the sides of the saucepan until the mixture falls below 120F, then blend that stuff for about 5 minutes, until smoooth.

(Optional)now is a good time to reuse the saucepan to steam some broccoli florets. best if cut into 8mm slices.

Back at the blender, add in the garlic powder, nutritional yeast, and lemon zest. Pulse to combine, then salt to taste, and pulse again. This sauce never gets too smooth. 

Take the squash out of the oven, flip over each half.  Scoop out the flesh from the husk.

For plating, spread out squash strands, then any chicken or broccoli, then a generous drizzle of the white sauce, finally topping with any black pepper & parsley you'd like.
